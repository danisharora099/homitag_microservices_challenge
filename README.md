This is a backend development challenge task for Homitag - 

The microservices include:
1. Genres
2. Movies
and use MongoDB as a database
 
The 2 repositories have been added to their parent (this) as submodules; To clone this directory along with the submodules, please run the following commands: 
```
git clone git@github.com:danisharora099/homitag_microservices_challenge.git
```
After cloning, cd into the directory and run:
```

```

You can then build & run the APIs using Docker:

``
